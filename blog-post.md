# Introducing the WordPress Development MCP Server: Your AI Assistant's New Best Friend

*Why we built the most comprehensive WordPress development resource hub for AI assistants, and why you should care*

---

## The Problem: AI Assistants Need Better WordPress Knowledge

Picture this: You're working on a complex WordPress project, and you turn to your AI assistant for help. You ask about implementing a custom post type with proper security, or setting up a block theme with custom patterns. What happens next?

**The AI gives you generic advice.** Maybe it knows some WordPress basics, but it doesn't understand the nuances, the security implications, or the modern best practices that separate amateur code from professional-grade WordPress development.

This isn't the AI's fault â€“ it's a data problem. Most AI assistants are trained on publicly available documentation, which often lacks the depth, context, and real-world examples that developers need.

## The Solution: A Purpose-Built WordPress Knowledge Base

Enter the **WordPress Development MCP Server** â€“ a comprehensive resource hub that transforms any AI assistant into a WordPress development expert.

Built by [Iconick](https://iconick.io), this isn't just another documentation dump. It's a carefully curated collection of **78 specialized resources** covering every aspect of professional WordPress development.
